## Installation

Please note that this software is now an alpha release. Initial conda packages are available, but have not been tested in integration against our other plugins yet. For now, create a fresh conda environment for q2-fmt using the following command:

Mac OS instructions 
```bash
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/fmt/qiime2-fmt-2023.9-py38-osx-conda.yml
CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda env create -n qiime2-fmt-2023.9 --file qiime2-fmt-2023.9-py38-osx-conda.yml
conda activate qiime2-fmt-2023.9
conda config --env --set subdir osx-64
```
Linux instructions
```bash
wget https://data.qiime2.org/distro/fmt/qiime2-fmt-2023.9-py38-linux-conda.yml
conda env create -n qiime2-fmt-2023.9 --file qiime2-fmt-2023.9-py38-linux-conda.yml
```
Then activate your new environment as usual.
```bash
conda activate q2-fmt-2023.9
```
Please be aware that `q2-fmt` and `q2-stats` will be the only visible plugins in this environment.

## Examples
Example data can be generated using the `--example-data` flag on each action
described below. This will create a directory structure to match the examples
(you will need to `cd` into the appropriate directory first).

```bash
qiime fmt --example-data fmt-examples/
cd fmt-examples/engraftment/engraftment-baseline/
```

**Plot Engraftment**

This pipeline will execute the below actions in order to produce engraftment
plots in a single step. To learn more, see the examples below this.
```bash
qiime fmt engraftment \
  --i-diversity-measure div-measure.qza \
  --m-metadata-file md.tsv \
  --p-compare baseline \
  --p-time-column week \
  --p-reference-column InitialDonorSampleID \
  --p-subject-column SubjectID \
  --p-where '[SampleType]="stool"' \
  --p-filter-missing-references \
  --p-against-group 0 \
  --p-p-val-approx asymptotic \
  --o-stats stats.qza \
  --o-raincloud-plot raincloud-plot.qzv
```

---

**Group Timepoints**

First the data must be collected from your study and organized into groups with
some relevant diversity measure. We will use Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity in
these examples, but other measures, including beta diversity metrics, are
supported.

This command will produce two collections of groups: one for subjects at each
timepoint, and another for references/donors and any control groups.
```bash
qiime fmt group-timepoints \
  --i-diversity-measure div-measure.qza \
  --m-metadata-file md.tsv \
  --p-where '[SampleType]="stool"' \
  --p-time-column week \
  --p-reference-column InitialDonorSampleID \
  --p-subject-column SubjectID \
  --p-filter-missing-references \
  --o-timepoint-dists timepoint-dists.qza \
  --o-reference-dists reference-dists.qza
```

**Statistical Tests**

Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests and Mann-Whitney U tests are available through
[q2-stats](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-stats) and can be used for FMT analysis.
These two tests are differentiated by the semantic type of the input to ensure
the applicability of the test (i.e. only matched pairs for Wilcoxon,
and independent groups for Mann-Whitney).

Comparisons for Wilcoxon Signed Rank:
 - baseline: Compare each timepoint against a reference timpoint
 - consecutive: Compare each timepoint against its next timepoint

Comparisons for Mann-Whitney U:
 - reference: Compare other groups against a particular reference group
 - all-pairwise: Compare all pairwise groups.

The `against-each` parameter is needed to compare the timepoints against the
references/controls. The `engraftment` pipeline above does this
automatically.

```bash
qiime stats wilcoxon-srt \
  --i-distribution timepoint-dists.qza \
  --p-compare baseline \
  --p-baseline-group 0 \
  --p-p-val-approx asymptotic \
  --o-stats stats_baseline0.qza
```

**Raincloud Plots**

Also available through [q2-stats](https://github.com/qiime2/q2-stats) -
a statistical test is not required to generate the plots, but if provided,
will produce a table showing the results of the test.
```bash
qiime stats plot-rainclouds \
  --i-data timepoint-dists.qza \
  --i-stats stats_baseline0.qza \
  --o-visualization raincloud-baseline0.qzv
```

`q2-fmt` is a QIIME 2 community plugin, meaning that it is not necessarily developed and maintained by the developers of QIIME 2.
Please be aware that because community plugins are developed by the QIIME 2 developer community, and not necessarily the QIIME 2 developers themselves, some may not be actively maintained or compatible with current release versions of the QIIME 2 distributions.

If you need help with a community plugin, first refer to the [project website](https://example.com).
If that page doesn't provide information on how to get help, or you need additional help, head to the [Community Plugins category](https://forum.qiime2.org/c/community-contributions/community-plugins/14) on the QIIME 2 Forum where the QIIME 2 developers will do their best to help you.
